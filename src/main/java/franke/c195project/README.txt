How to run the program
Once the program compiles, the user is presented with a login screen.
Users must have valid login credentials that match credentials in database.
Once logged in, users are able to add/edit/delete customers and appointments.
They also have a reports page available that pulls specific reports from the database.


Additional report
For the custom report, I chose to display the number of customers present in the database.
A very simple SQL query but something I believe most businesses should be keeping track of.
